## Project Duplication for New GitHub Repository

### Major Decision: Repository Duplication

The original volcano audio streaming project has been duplicated to create a new GitHub repository. This allows us to:

1. **Separate Event Focus**: Create a dedicated GitHub page for this specific event
2. **Optimized Development**: Continue building an optimized page specifically for this event (`index.html`)
3. **Clean Slate**: Start fresh with version tracking for this new repository

### Current State

- **Repository**: Fresh Git repository (no commits yet)
- **Version**: Current codebase shows v1.39 (from original project)
- **First Push**: Preparing for initial commit to new GitHub repository
- **Focus**: Optimizing `index.html` for the specific event needs

### Next Steps

- Set up GitHub remote repository
- Establish initial version number for first push
- Continue optimizing `index.html` for event-specific requirements
- Document version increments going forward
